AirBnB but for Programmers in #realtime #agile #dynamicenvironments

Project Description
=======

PairBnB makes it possible for programmers to network, learn from, teach and host like-minded individuals.

The main purpose of our app is to facilitate networking within the tech industry and help programmers who are looking to travel and spread their knowledge. It works by allowing users to offer their help through pair programming in exchange for a place to stay. We envision it being used to help programmers who believe in open source code and the benefits of pair programming.
