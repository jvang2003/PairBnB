AirBnB but for Programmers in #realtime #agile #dynamicenvironments

Project Description
=======

PairBnB makes it possible for programmers to network, learn from, teach and host like-minded individuals.

PairBnB facilitates networking within the tech industry and help programmers who are looking to travel and spread their knowledge. Users can offer their technical expertise in exchange for a place to stay. The goal is to help programmers who believe in open source code and the benefits of pair programming.

Enumerate some features here. The above blurb is a bit wordy. I NEED BULLETS.
